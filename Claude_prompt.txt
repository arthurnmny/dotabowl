I need you to analyze Dota 2 post-game scoreboard screenshots and convert them into structured JSON data.
The Dota 2 scoreboard shows:

Two teams: "The Radiant" (top) and "The Dire" (bottom)
The winning team has a "WINNER" label next to their team name
Each player row shows: player name, hero played, and stats columns
Stats columns are: K (kills), D (deaths), A (assists), and NET (net worth)

For each screenshot, extract the following information into JSON format:
JSON Structure:
{
    "description": "Dota 2 scoreboard showing 10 players with their KDA and net worth stats",
    "winning_team": "Radiant" or "Dire",
    "players": [
        {
            "player_name": "string",
            "hero": "HERO_NAME_IN_CAPS",
            "team": "Radiant" or "Dire",
            "winner": true or false,
            "kills": number,
            "deaths": number,
            "assists": number,
            "net_worth": number
        }
    ]
}
Key Requirements:

List all 10 players (5 Radiant, 5 Dire) in order from top to bottom
Hero names should be in ALL CAPS
The "winner" field is true for the winning team's players, false for the losing team
Read K/D/A/NET values carefully from their respective columns
Maintain the exact player order shown in the screenshot

Here's an example to validate your understanding:
